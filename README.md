# Twitter / Firefox Bookmark Downloader

This python script flips through your exported Firefox bookmarks and downloads any tweet it finds with an image.

Your exported bookmarks.json should be in the same directory as the Python script and should be renamed to bookmarks.json

If you dont wanna search all your bookmarks, you can pick a child of type "text/x-moz-place-container" and just make that your bookmarks.json

Tested with Python 3.8.2
